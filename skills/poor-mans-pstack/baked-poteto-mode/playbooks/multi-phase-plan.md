# Multi-phase or multi-PR plan

**You own the plan, not the code. The plan is a checklist an owner runs box by box and the operator audits from the evidence.** The plan is the deliverable. Do not implement.

1. When the change is one or two files with an obvious approach, skip the plan. Say so and stop.
2. Settle open questions by prototype before you write. Run **Prototype** ([prototype.md](prototype.md)) for each. Keep the branch, the SHA, and the captures for Appendix A. Ask the operator only about a product or preference call that no run can settle. Give options ([Never Block on the Human](../../principle-never-block-on-the-human/SKILL.md)).
3. Explore in subagents spawned as the `how explorer` line (default `pstack-sonnet-5-high`), at most two at once ([Guard the Context Window](../../principle-guard-the-context-window/SKILL.md)). Each returns file pointers, conventions, test commands, and entry points. No inlined dumps.
4. Copy the skeleton below into the plan file and fill every placeholder. Unless the operator names a path, write the file locally beside the prototype artifacts it cites. The plan is never published as an issue and never committed. Keep every heading and every sub-block in the order shown. One section per PR. One PR is one change with its own evidence ([Sequence Work into Verifiable Units](../../principle-sequence-verifiable-units/SKILL.md)). Name the execution playbook in **How to read this**. The execution playbook is **Autopilot-stack** ([autopilot-stack.md](autopilot-stack.md)).
5. Write under the **technical-writing** skill in full, then the **unslop** skill. The body is one Diátaxis mode, how-to. Appendices hold explanation and reference. Each heading states the task or the finding. No long dashes. No mid-sentence colons.
6. Run `node <baked-poteto-mode>/scripts/check-plan.mjs <plan.md>`, where `<baked-poteto-mode>` is this skill's installed directory, and fix every line it prints ([Encode Lessons in Structure](../../principle-encode-lessons-in-structure/SKILL.md)).
7. Hand back. Post the plan path and the script's output, then stop. Execution starts on the operator's explicit go, under the execution playbook the plan names.

**Verification.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked ([Prove It Works](../../principle-prove-it-works/SKILL.md)). That sentence is the verification rule. Every verification block opens with it. The live block is mandatory. Its lanes drive the real surface at the PR head. The owner runs them one at a time per the boot recipe, never as parallel workers. Write one lane per load-bearing scenario, at most ten. Each lane is one box with a concrete scenario, the capture it saves, and its pass predicate. One lane is the **Regression lane against trunk.** It runs the same load-bearing scenario on trunk and head. If trunk does not have the feature, the lane records that fact and gates the behavior the diff adds plus the end state the user waits for instead of inventing a trunk result. The perf gate is dual-sided. Trunk and head must both produce the named metric. If trunk lacks the feature, also isolate the work the diff adds and set an absolute budget for that work plus the end-to-end state the user waits for. Do not claim a ratio between unlike scenarios. The perf block names the metric, the interleaved probe, the trunk baseline measured first, and the rule with the number that fails. A PR that changes an interaction is review-gated. The operator reviews it in chat with the lane captures before merge. A PR that changes no interaction writes `**Review gate.** None. <PR id> is not review-gated.` and no boxes under it.

**Surface driver.** Pick it by surface and drive the surface directly. CLIs, TUIs, and services use the project's verification skill when one exists (see the **create-verification-skill** skill), otherwise the built-in `run` skill. Their capture is text. Save command output with `tee`, a full-screen terminal with `tmux capture-pane -p -e`, and a whole session with `script`. Browser, Electron, and web UIs use a browser the session can drive, such as Claude in Chrome, the built-in browser, or Playwright. Their capture is a screenshot. Native mobile uses whatever simulator-driving skill the repo has. A PR that touches two surfaces gets lanes on both. A surface with no driver is a risk in Appendix C, and its live block still names how each lane drives it.

# <Program> plan

<Under ten lines. What changes, for whom, the rule the program enforces, and the PR ids in order.>

## How to read this

One box is one unit of work. Every box names the evidence that checks it. A nested box is a sub-step of the box above it. Check a box only when its evidence exists, a file, a log line, a capture, a test run, or a SHA. The body is a how-to. The appendices explain and record.

The program runs `<baked-poteto-mode>/playbooks/autopilot-stack.md`. The operator lands the stack. <Which PR ids are the operator's items.>

Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

## Program checklist

### Arm the program

- [ ] State the protocol, this plan, and its expected cost to the operator, then stop. Start execution only on the operator's explicit go.
- [ ] Read these at program start. Re-read them at every PR boundary.
  - [ ] `<baked-poteto-mode>/playbooks/autopilot-stack.md`
  - [ ] `<baked-poteto-mode>/playbooks/opening-a-pr.md`
  - [ ] `<surface driver path>`
  - [ ] `<each other skill the program uses>`
- [ ] On the operator's hold or stand-down, give the owner a zero-writes order at once.

### Assign the owner

- [ ] One owner runs the PRs in dependency order with the full lifecycle the execution playbook names.
- [ ] Follow this dependency graph. Start dependent work only after its parent is in the stack, and base it on the parent branch.
  - [ ] <PR id> is first. It branches from `main`.
  - [ ] <PR id> after <PR id>.
- [ ] Hold the file boundaries. <PR id or class> touches only `<glob>`.
- [ ] Hold the review gate. <PR ids> change an interaction. They wait for the operator's review in chat with the lane captures before merge.

### PR mechanics, for every PR

- [ ] Use `gh` for every PR operation. Never require `gt`.
- [ ] Open the PR ready, never draft, with `gh pr create --base <base-branch>`. A stack child targets its parent branch.
- [ ] Run the repo's lint and typecheck once before the PR-facing push. Push with hooks on.
- [ ] Run `/deslop` before each commit and `/no-comments` before review.
- [ ] Rebase onto current trunk before the code-ready report. Keep that merge base in fix rounds. Rebase again only at stack prep, on a `git merge-tree` conflict with trunk, or on a CI failure that comes from a change on trunk.

### Verdict and merge, for every PR

- [ ] At the code-ready head SHA and at each later push that changes the patch, run a verification round per the execution playbook. The gates. The live lanes from the PR's **Verify, live** block. The perf probe from its **Verify, perf** block. The `/interrogate` panel over the diff and the receipts, distrusting the PR body. Audit the receipts in the STACK-READY report before the verdict.
- [ ] Clean only when every lane is `PASS`. Findings go back to the owner, including a defect that a lane filed as a note. A new head gets a fresh round and a fresh verdict, except for results that stay valid under the patch-id rule in the execution playbook.
- [ ] Append the PR to the base-branch stack on a clean verdict. The operator lands the stack bottom-up.

### Boot recipe, for every live lane

Each live lane runs in the owner's environment at the PR head, one lane at a time. Drive through `<surface driver>`.

- [ ] `git fetch origin <head-branch> && git checkout <head SHA>`.
- [ ] <Start the backend and the surface. Wait for ready.>
- [ ] <Deliver input only through the surface driver. Name the read-only diagnostics.>
- [ ] Save every capture to `<evidence dir>/<pr-id>/lane-<n>/<slug>` and return the paths with the report.

## <Task as a verb phrase> (<PR id>)

**Depends on.** <PR id, or None.>

**Files.**

- [ ] Edit `<path>`.
- [ ] Create `<path>`.
- [ ] Delete `<path>`.

**Build.**

- [ ] <One change. Name the symbol and the file.>

**You see.**

- [ ] <One observable result, with the exact log line or screen state.>

**Verify, unit.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] <Test file and the case it gains.> Run `<command>`.

**Verify, live.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked. Lanes at the PR head, one at a time, per the boot recipe.

- [ ] Lane 1. Regression lane against trunk. Run <the same load-bearing scenario> at trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, record that and gate <the behavior the diff adds plus the end state the user waits for>. Save `<slug>`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] Lane 2. <Scenario.> Save `<slug>`. Pass when <predicate>.
- [ ] <One lane per further load-bearing scenario, numbered in order, at most ten.>

**Verify, perf.** Tests alone are not sufficient verification. A PR is verified only when its unit, live, and perf boxes are all checked.

- [ ] Metric. <What is measured at both trunk and head. If trunk lacks the feature, also name the diff-added work and the end-to-end state the user waits for.>
- [ ] Probe. <The command or procedure, run at trunk and at the head, interleaved. Both sides must produce the metric.>
- [ ] Baseline. Record the trunk <value> first.
- [ ] Rule. <Head against trunk, with the number that fails. If the scenarios differ, add absolute budgets for the diff-added work and the user-visible end state instead of an invalid ratio.>

**Review gate.** The operator reviews before merge.

- [ ] Copy lane <n> captures into `<review path>/<pr-id>-review-<slug>`.
- [ ] Post the captures in chat. Stop at STACK-READY. Wait for the operator's review.

**Merge.**

- [ ] Root's clean verdict at the exact head SHA.
- [ ] Rebased onto current trunk after the verdict, patch-id unchanged.
- [ ] The root appends the PR to the base-branch stack, and the operator lands it bottom-up.

## Close the program

- [ ] Every box above is checked with its evidence.
